# Face Recognition App

## Description
This is a face recognition app I made while I was learning React. Users can upload pictures, or use camera. The app recognizes faces and gives an age estimation.

In this application I used the following technologies:
- React
- Styled Components
- Face.api.js

## Installation
You can simply clone this repository, and run "npm install" to install dependencies, then use "npm start" to start the application.

## Usage
Upload a picture or use the camera. The app will detect faces and it gives an age estimation.
